### ========================================
### TEST SCENARIO EXPLANATION
### ========================================
### 
### 1. Driver registers weight at weighing bridge
### 2. System immediately returns "PROCESSING" status
### 3. Landside Context publishes TruckLeftWeighingBridge event
### 4. Warehousing Context receives event and assigns warehouse
### 5. Warehousing Context publishes WarehouseAssigned event
### 6. Landside Context receives event and updates truck movement
### 7. Driver can check status to get warehouse number
### 
### This demonstrates the complete asynchronous flow
### from weight registration to warehouse assignment.

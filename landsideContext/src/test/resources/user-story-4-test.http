### USER STORY 4: Register Weight and Receive Warehouse Number
### ========================================

### Step 1: Register truck weight and exit bridge
### This triggers the async warehouse assignment process
POST http://localhost:8190/api/landside/weight-registration/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "licensePlate": "TRK-001",
  "weight": 25000.0,
  "rawMaterialName": "Gypsum"
}

### Expected Response:
### {
###   "licensePlate": "TRK-001",
###   "status": "PROCESSING",
###   "message": "Weight registered successfully. Warehouse assignment in progress.",
###   "warehouseNumber": null
### }

### Step 1.1: Register truck weight and exit bridge
### This triggers the async warehouse assignment process
POST http://localhost:8190/api/landside/weight-registration/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "licensePlate": "TRK-002",
  "weight": 25000.0,
  "rawMaterialName": "Gypsum"
}


### Step 2: Check warehouse assignment status
### This checks if the warehouse has been assigned asynchronously
GET http://localhost:8190/api/landside/weight-registration/status/TRK-001

### Expected Response (if still processing):
### {
###   "licensePlate": "TRK-001",
###   "status": "PROCESSING",
###   "message": "Warehouse assignment in progress",
###   "warehouseNumber": null
### }

### Expected Response (if warehouse assigned):
### {
###   "licensePlate": "TRK-001",
###   "status": "COMPLETED",
###   "message": "Warehouse assigned successfully",
###   "warehouseNumber": "WH-001"
### }

### Step 2.1: Check status again (to verify warehouse assignment)
GET http://localhost:8190/api/landside/weight-registration/status/TRK-002



### ========================================
### TEST SCENARIO EXPLANATION
### ========================================
### 
### 1. Driver registers weight at weighing bridge
### 2. System immediately returns "PROCESSING" status
### 3. Landside Context publishes TruckLeftWeighingBridge event
### 4. Warehousing Context receives event and assigns warehouse
### 5. Warehousing Context publishes WarehouseAssigned event
### 6. Landside Context receives event and updates truck movement
### 7. Driver can check status to get warehouse number
### 
### This demonstrates the complete asynchronous flow
### from weight registration to warehouse assignment.
